**Project Overview**

This CNN model is designed for image classification, specifically targeting a dataset with images of size 48x48 with one color channel (grayscale). 
The model uses four convolutional layers, followed by two fully connected layers to learn and classify image features.

**Key Features:**

Convolutional Layers: Capture spatial hierarchies in images.
Batch Normalization: Normalize activations for stable training.
Dropout Layers: Prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons.
Activation Functions: Uses ReLU activation for non-linearity.
Softmax Output: Final layer with 7 classes for classification.

**Model Architecture**

The model architecture consists of four convolutional layers with increasing depth, each followed by Batch Normalization, Max Pooling, and Dropout layers. 
The convolutional layers are followed by two fully connected (dense) layers, then output via a softmax layer for multi-class classification.
